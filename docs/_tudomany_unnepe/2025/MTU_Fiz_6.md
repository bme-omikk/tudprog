Water ice is one of the most valuable lunar resources, essential for future missions, permanent human presence and habitats on the Moon. Thus it is crucial to find, characterize and map lunar water. Sustainable lunar water extraction - and other resource extraction like oxygen - will catalyze the establishment of permanent outpostson the Moon and boost the creation of an affordable cislunar and deep space transportation system, making space transportation more sustainable, efficient, and ubiquitous. Puli Space's NASA awarded Puli Lunar Water Snooper (PLWS) is designed to detect hydrogen and therefore all hydrogen-bearing volatiles like water ice, it can measure quantity and distribution of these resources in the lunar surface regolith. Flown on the IM-2 Mission of Intuitive Machines to the Lunar South Pole region, on 6th March 2025 the PLWS became the first ever Hungarian instrument to land and operate on the Moon.
